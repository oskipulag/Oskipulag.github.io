## Introduction

I am the 100Ï€th finisher of this years Flare-On, I will share how I completed the challenges. As a bonus, I will solve each challenge with a different tool. Mandatory proof:

I think the *anonymous* accounts are not used in the official counting, even though they are shown on the progress overview at [this years scoreboard](https://2021.flare-on.com/scoreboard). So I corrected the above image for this inconvenience.

Note: I have never written a write-up, let alone 10. So I won't promise I will cover all of the challenges, bet let's see how far I'll come doing so.
